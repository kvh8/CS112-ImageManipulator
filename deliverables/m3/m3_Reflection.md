Milestone # 3 - Reflection

In all honesty, this one got me. I did not think it was going to be as hard as it was. Sure, there was
warning from Adam, and I believed him. However, I did not beieve him to enough to make me put in more time. 
I figured I could bust it out  in the last week it was due. That was a mistake I do not plan on making again. 

Honestly, the concepts are not hard. I wrote a lot of what I knew was going to happen before I wrote the
code to read it into a 2d vector. The hardest part is the logic because you know how it is supposed to 
look, but the computer is just so gosh darn dumb that it is frustrating. It so easy in concept, but 
the practice is very difficult. 

With horizontal and blur, I feel I am so close to getting it, but there is just one logistical key that
I am missing. Which tends to be I go out of the range of the vector, and I am not sure how to get it back in. Or I get it in the range, but all the code I just wrote does nothing to the image. It is very frustratin, espceially when I change the code, and still nothing changes with the image. It makes me want to rip all my hair out. It is just a bummer when you think something should be so simple and yet it turns out to be much more complicated than you gave it credit for. To be fair, I did procrastinate on this one big time. I am usually so good with keeping up, but these last few weeks I have been really out of it. I want to blame it on pre-break jitters, but I really need to keep my head in the game.

Although there was a lot of failure, I definitely learned more about myself and how to prioritize my time. I may not have been able to complete all the tasks, but I feel I can get definitly get them don by the end of the week. I may not get full points for this assignment, but I want to complete it so I know how to do it for future reference. It can only benefit me in the end.
