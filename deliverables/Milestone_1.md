Image Manipulator Reflection

The image manipulator milestone was actually very simple for me to complete
since I had completed the PA3. I used all of my code from PA3 for this assignment
and then changed the code so that it can manipulate the file in the way it needs to.
Once I had all the code that changes the data, I wrote a switch that uses the 
users choice of effect to decide which effect will be put onto the data.

The most difficult aspect of this assignment was creating the code for grayscale.
I originally wanted to create a for loop inside another for loop that will go 
through the first three sets of rgb data then change each to the average of the 
three. However, I realized that it was only going through the first three numbers 
and did not move on to the next three. So instead of another loop, I changed it to 
an if that said if the number does not equal to average make it equal to the 
average, and then in the loop it changed for every three. It was a simple fix that
I am glad I caught early on.

Other than the grayscale, creating the code was very simple and did not take much time. 
I am very happy with my progress in this class because in the beginning I was a bit 
overwhelmed, but once I got back into the routine of going to school and studiyng again,
it was easy to catch back up. I am a bit concerned for our first exam because I am not
sure what to expect or study because I don't feel like our assignments have been very 
reflective of our what we do during lectures. But, that's what I need to work on. I 
need to study and practice outside of class, not just with the assignments. It is a 
learning curve that I need to get with because not everything will be handed to me
in a packet with detailed instructions.
